"Sports Basics" is a sports blog company that entered into the market recently.

They wanted to get more traffic to their website by releasing a special edition magazine on IPL 2024.

This magazine aims to provide interesting insights and facts for fans, analysts and teams based on the last 3 years' data.

Using Power BI, I delved into the last 3 years' data to uncover key insights requested for both primary and secondary analysis.
